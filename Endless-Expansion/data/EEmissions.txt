I will keep you updated if there are any developments." Rek said before bowing her head slightly. After that you finally get to the spaceport, you're starving. And with the payment coming in from the Efret government, you intend on buying out the first restaurant you find.`

The Quarg listened, then slowly nodded before leading you through the halls of the ring world and having you wait in a small meeting room. After 20 minutes, what you think is a new Quarg arrives.`
            `   "It is the understanding of this one that you wish to ensure the safety of the ones you call refugees?" You quickly nod your head and the Quarg slowly does the same. "It is of good fortune that some of the Exiles wish to no longer partake as their kin do, but wary one must be. Do you, of sound mind, know of the refugees' intentions?"`

            `   "Perhaps, and it is our hope that the Exiles finally journey to the path of wisdom like the Efreti. However, much work still remains to be done for this to transpire." The Quarg then stands from its seat.`

Rek speaks to them in their language for a moment before placing the box on the table, hooking it to the console in the center of the table and played the recording.`
            `   The both the refugees and the Efret seem relieved at the Quarg's statements, but the refugees become uneasy when the Quarg states that it required them to forfeit their jump drives. Discussion begins between the two groups, with Rek attempting to act as a mediator. During a quick break in the discussion Rek looks back at you.`
            `   "Sorry <first>, this may take awhile. Wait for me in the spaceport, I will come to you when we have decided on our next course of action." She then snapped back into being mediator just as the two groups began talking again.`
